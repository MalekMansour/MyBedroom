MyBedroom Navigation Bar
MyBedroom is designed to be your centralized hub for curating and exploring digital content. The side navigation bar makes it easy to switch between different content types, each represented by a dedicated icon. Here’s what each icon will do:

Chat:
This section creates a real-time communication space where you can engage in discussions with friends or fellow users. It can include one-on-one messaging, group chats, and even public discussion boards, so you can share insights about interesting websites or ask for recommendations while you browse your digital library.

Images:
The Images icon opens up a dedicated gallery where you can store, manage, and share visual content related to your favorite websites. This area might include features for uploading screenshots, browsing curated collections, or tagging images so you can easily link them to specific website entries.

Videos:
Clicking on Videos will take you to a space for curating video content. Whether it’s video tutorials, reviews, or any video-based media from the websites you save, this section lets you preview, categorize, and even create playlists of curated video content relevant to your interests.

Audio:
The Audio section is intended to house all things sound. Here, you can save links to podcasts, music streams, or any audio clips you find interesting. Features might include audio previews, playlists, and even integration with external audio platforms so you can listen directly through MyBedroom.

Websites:
This is the core of MyBedroom—the digital encyclopedia for your favorite online destinations. In this section, you can add, manage, and organize links to various websites. It could provide details like site summaries, user ratings, tags, or even snapshots of the page, helping you keep track of the content you love.

This navigation bar is intended to offer a seamless and organized way to navigate your diverse content collections, ensuring that no matter what format the content comes in—be it a chat conversation, a visual image, a video, or audio clip—you can access and interact with it quickly and efficiently.
